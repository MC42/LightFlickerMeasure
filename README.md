# LightFlickerMeasure
Measures flickering lights, like PWM driven LED-systems, using Arduino Uno.

An old Light Bulb sends 80% constant light and a 20% sine waveform as noise of 100 Hz ontop, so no flicker is recognized.

This LED Streetlamp sends a permanent PWM of 264 Hz instead of a steady light! Go for a walk at night, this lamp is really annoying.
